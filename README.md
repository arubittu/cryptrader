getData.py gets the data from the binance test api (i put a for loop of 10 so 10 entries will be appended to the database every time this program is run) and adds it to database.csv file which has columns price and date (timestamp) of bitcoin . strategy.py is the where there will be strategy functions. and main.py is currently just pseudo code but its enough cause there really isnt much , basically it will at every time the database is updated run the strategy on it and give output action to buy/sell or hold on the latest price. and then i will just call the buy/sell api to register order. (action column is currently not there in database, will add that later)
